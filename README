To run the game:
python ./asteroid.py

You will need python and pyglet installed in order to play.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Simple asteroids clone written in Python with the Pyglet library. 


This is my first game, so I don't expect it will be at all perfect. 
Progress will be slow, but it will get done.
